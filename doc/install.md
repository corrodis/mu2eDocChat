## Python environment
It might be worth to start with a clean python environment. I don't think that's really needed though.
```bash
python -m venv --clear .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

## Development mode
Run the following in the base folder of the cloned repository (only needs to be done ones)
```bash
pip install -e .
```
